Just a simple program that will take in a text file of single byte hex values (00-FF) and output them to the console as strings<br>

after compiling, use via command line ./htt sample_input.txt<br>

will ignore whitespace and non-hex value characters, works with hex written in caps or non-caps or a mix. <br>
